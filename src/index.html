                <h1>Courses</h1>
                <p><strong>Fundamentals of Computer Science (H3032L)</strong>: This is intended as a first course for
                    those students
                    just beginning the study of computer science. Students will foster their creativity and innovation
                    through
                    opportunities to design, implement, and present solutions to real-world problems. Students will
                    collaborate and
                    use computer science concepts to access, analyze, and evaluate information needed to solve problems.
                    Students
                    will learn the problem-solving and reasoning skills that are the foundation of computer science.</p>
                <p><strong>Computer Science I Pre-AP (H3005L):</strong> Course introduces students to programming with
                    several web
                    page languages including HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript.  Students are then introduced to beginning
                    programming
                    with Python and an introduction to Java.</p>
                <p><strong>AP Computer Science A (H3010L):</strong> This is the last of the programming courses and is
                    "equivalent
                    to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The course emphasizes both
                    object-oriented and
                    imperative problem solving and design using Java language."(APCentral) This course teaches advanced
                    programming
                    and emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and
                    algorithm
                    development.  This course prepares students to take the Advanced Placement (AP) exam that can be
                    used for
                    college credit.</p>

                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Due to our vertical approach, students moving in to our high school program from our middle school
                    program have
                    had extensive coding exposure and practice. Students in this pathway will earn their Technology
                    endorsement with
                    a focus on computer science. During the course of their studies, students will become highly
                    proficient in the
                    use of HTML and Java.</p>
                <p>Specialization - Computer Science, with a focus on different computer language including HTML and
                    Java.</p>
                <p>For those students looking to be challenged outside of the classroom, it is highly encouraged that
                    students
                    participate in CyberPatriot. This provides students with real-world application opportunities, as
                    well as the
                    potential to earn national recognition and scholarships.</p>

                    <p><strong>About</strong></p>
                    <p>I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX. I attended NEISD schools, Jackson-Keller Elementary,
                        Nimitz
                        Academy, and graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in 2003. I completed my Bachelor of Arts
                        in
                        Interdisciplinary Studies EC-4 from the University of the Incarnate Word in Dec. 2007. I taught
                        in SAISD for
                        9 years in Prek, 2nd, and 3rd Grade. I completed my Master of Arts in Education with a
                        Concentration in
                        Instructional Technology from UTSA in 2018. I substituted for a year in NEISD and found my new
                        home here at
                        STEM Academy. This is my 5th year at STEM and I love teaching Computer Science.</p>
