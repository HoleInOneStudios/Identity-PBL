                        This is intended as a first course for those students just beginning the study of computer
                        science. Students will foster
                        their creativity and innovation through opportunities to design, implement, and present
                        solutions to real-world
                        problems. Students will collaborate and use computer science concepts to access, analyze, and
                        evaluate information
                        needed to solve problems. Students will learn the problem-solving and reasoning skills that are
                        the foundation of
                        computer science.

                        Course introduces students to programming with several web page languages
                        including HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.  Students are then introduced to beginning programming with
                        Python and an
                        introduction to Java.

                        This is the last of the programming courses and is "equivalent to a first-semester,
                        college-level course in computer science.  The course emphasizes both object-oriented and
                        imperative problem solving and
                        design using Java language."(APCentral) This course teaches advanced programming and emphasizes
                        object-oriented
                        programming methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and algorithm development.  This
                        course prepares students to
                        take the Advanced Placement (AP) exam that can be used for college credit.
