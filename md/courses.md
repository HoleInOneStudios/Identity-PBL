**Fundamentals of Computer Science (H3032L)**: This is intended as a first course for those students just beginning the study of computer science. Students will foster their creativity and innovation through opportunities to design, implement, and present solutions to real-world problems. Students will collaborate and use computer science concepts to access, analyze, and evaluate information needed to solve problems. Students will learn the problem-solving and reasoning skills that are the foundation of computer science.

**Computer Science I Pre-AP (H3005L):** Course introduces students to programming with several web page languages including HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.  Students are then introduced to beginning programming with Python and an introduction to Java.

**AP Computer Science A (H3010L):** This is the last of the programming courses and is "equivalent to a first-semester, college-level course in computer science.  The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using Java language."(APCentral) This course teaches advanced programming and emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology with an emphasis on problem solving and algorithm development.  This course prepares students to take the Advanced Placement (AP) exam that can be used for college credit.
