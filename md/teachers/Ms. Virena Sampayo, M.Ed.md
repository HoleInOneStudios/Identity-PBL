### About

 I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX.  I attended NEISD schools, Jackson-Keller Elementary, Nimitz Academy, and graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in 2003.  I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies EC-4 from the University of the Incarnate Word in Dec. 2007. I taught in SAISD for 9 years in Prek, 2nd, and 3rd Grade.  I completed my Master of Arts in Education with a Concentration in Instructional Technology from UTSA in 2018. I substituted for a year in NEISD and found my new home here at STEM Academy.  This is my 5th year at STEM and I love teaching Computer Science.
